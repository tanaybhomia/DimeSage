## Works as Follows

Certainly! The financial score is calculated based on four main criteria, each contributing a certain weight to the overall score. Here's a breakdown of the calculation:

### 1. Income vs. Expense Ratio (50% Weight)

This ratio represents how well a user's total monthly income compares to their total monthly expenses. The formula is:

\[ \text{Income vs. Expense Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Monthly Income}}{\text{Total Monthly Expenses}} \]

The weight for this criterion is 50% of the overall score.

### 2. Saving Rate (30% Weight)

The saving rate is the percentage of a user's income that they save each month, including contributions towards their goal funds. The formula is:

\[ \text{Saving Rate} = \frac{\text{Total Monthly Savings}}{\text{Total Monthly Income}} \times 100 \]

The weight for this criterion is 30% of the overall score.

### 3. Budget Adherence (20% Weight)

Budget adherence assesses how well a user sticks to their budget for various expense categories. The formula is:

\[ \text{Budget Adherence} = \frac{\text{Total Actual Expenses}}{\text{Total Budgeted Expenses}} \times 100 \]

The weight for this criterion is 20% of the overall score.

### 4. Goal Funding (10% Weight)

Goal funding considers whether the user has set and achieved their financial goals. The formula is:

\[ \text{Goal Funding} = \frac{\text{Number of Achieved Goals}}{\text{Total Number of Goals}} \times 100 \]

The weight for this criterion is 10% of the overall score.

### Overall Financial Score Calculation

The overall financial score is calculated by combining the scores from each criterion with their respective weights:

\[ \text{Overall Financial Score} = (0.5 \times \text{Income vs. Expense Ratio}) + (0.3 \times \text{Saving Rate}) + (0.2 \times \text{Budget Adherence}) + (0.1 \times \text{Goal Funding}) \]

This composite score provides a comprehensive evaluation of the user's financial health, taking into account income, expenses, savings, budget adherence, and goal achievements.

The score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better financial health. Users can use this score as a metric to assess and improve their financial well-being over time.
